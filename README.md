# java-npm-practice

This project was set up following the steps at https://github.com/xword/java-npm-gradle-integration-example. Front and back end (javascript and java) combined under one project and build together with gradle.  

(But, does not "pack npm build result into a JAR and expose to the Java project" as in the last step of the example.)
